# MarketingPage

Marketing website I created that lives on my company's intranet. The folders are structured to be able to 

pull resources such as images, documents, fonts, styles, etc. from different locations inside of our 

intranet's SharePoint repository, but so that it would display correctly on github all the files were thrown in the same 

folder/repository. This site was created for employees to be able to come and grab 

different documents they may need on a day to day basis such as templates, logos, business card, and much 

more. I used basic HTML, SCSS, and JS to build the site and then copied all of the html code into a .txt 

file so that SharePoint could read the code that I wrote and properly display it on the intranet. Currently 

only the home and Brand & Branded Materials pages are available as that was all that was included in the 

initial launch of the redesign of the marketing team's section in our intranet. As new sections are created I will continue 

to update this project but for now, check out the home and branding materials page and critique 

the UI/UX that this page provides.
